\section{Problem Statement}\label{sec:problem}
-Multilevel summation method\cite{2}: Efficient method for evaluation of long-range interactions in $n$-body type problems. Traditionally used to calculate forces in molecular dynamics simulations.

-MSM important because permits linear time algorithm for evaluation. Traditionally FFT used, efficient but requires periodic domain; results in unwanted interactions from copies of domain in surrounding periodic repeats.

-Algorithm has similar structure/idea to multigrid v-cycle approaches: smoothing, restriction of smooth part to coarser grid, evaluation of new short range interactions (repeat until coarsest level), then interpolation of smooth parts back down cycle until finest level\cite{1}.

\section{Approach}\label{sec:main}
-Implement main parts of algorithm in Python: smooth part separation, restriction, short-range interaction, interpolation.

-For simplicity a serial implementation will be used.

-After implementation will test various random charge distributions with increasing number of charges to evaluate scaling performance for number of bodies.

\section{Numerical Results}\label{sec:num}
Smoothing (separation of short/long-distance parts of interaction) is first part of numerics being worked on currently.

-Example plot of smoothing implementation:

\caption{\label{fig:unrolled}Comparison of original and smoothed interaction for a single particle.}
\end{figure}

-Uses same smoothing approach as described in 2015 Hardy paper \cite{1}.

\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conc}
